# select_venv

# Why?

I'm tired of activating different enviornment each time.
So I decide to create this program.

I know it is possible to activate by register in the registry...but how many timess??!!
# Folders need to create
  E:\pyworld\prgmworld .
  E:\pyworld\venvworld .

create every virtual enviornment in venvworld

that's how it works

Yes, I know it's not a big thing...peace out...

Thank you.
