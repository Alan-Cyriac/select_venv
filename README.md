# Neccessity is the Mother of All Inventions

# Why?

I'm tired of activating different enviornment each time Aooooshh(Zzzz..Zzzz)...
So I decide to create this program. (NB: Neccessity is the Mother of All Inventions)

I know it is possible to activate by register in the registry...but how many timess??!!
I cannot register every venv in the registy(By the way, I am using windows).

What I'm telling is, if you want to change the code style, ya you can..without changing the purpose.
For those whose not willing to change anything, I insist to change the "path" variable to your required path where the venv is located.

# I decided to put all venv inside a specific folder...(Just remember that..)
that's how it works...(efficently)


Yes, I know it's not a big thing...peace out...

Thank you.
